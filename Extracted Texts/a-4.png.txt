‘Half the intrigue

CBS sitcom
disappoints in final
season premiere

By KAREN HUA
Daily Arts Writer

This past Thursday, the
iconic sitcom “Two and a Half
Men” premiered its twelfth and

final season.

The show

historically

has been one Two and a
of the most

beloved and Half Men

At this point, cps

it seems like

CBS continues

to renew the show simply for
the sake of tradition. While it
is true “Men” has become a
sort of American legend, the
show’s audience is waning and
demonstrates little potential for
growth.

Now with the absence of
Charlie (Charlie Sheen, “Anger
Management”),
have turned away, even with the
younger, cleaner Walden (Ashton
Kutcher, “No Strings Attached”)
as asubstitute. With Alan’s John
Cryer, “Pretty in Pink”) brother
gone, and his son Jake (Angus
T. Jones, “The Rookie”) “in the
army,” the show can only come
up with so many fresh premises
for two grown male best friends
that have not been used in sitcoms
before.

The title no longer makes sense,
as Jake is now not only a legal
adult, but he is also absent in the
premiere. Even though this will
be its final season, “Men” must
only come up with a multitude of
excuses for the disappearance of
characters as the show runs on
diminishing possibilities.

Whether or not the producers
like it, they cannot stop the
audience from automatically

Perhaps firing the volatile Sheen
helped their industry’s image, but
many argue that the series should

dismissal. The original character
dynamic is simply unparalleled.
Regardless of Kutcher’s talent,
Sheen still stands as the face of
he show, as he has a #winning
stage presence that simply cannot

The premiere with

sarcasm.

The premiere continues this
pattern of amalgamating hilarious
moments with artificial
o the point where the writing
simply feels uncomfortable.
There are far too many instances
when Walden’s lines are so overdramatically presented that it is
ambiguous whether he truly is
trying to sarcastic or genuine.

Especially when Walden pokes
fun at Alan, the jokes seemed
rehearsed and timed, without
the spontaneity that is supposed
to qualify his character as witty.
The humor becomes too cheesy,
especially when it is ambiguous —
at least initially — whether Walden
legitimately has a heart attack or
whether he fakes it for attention.

During Walden’s contemplation
of his “purpose of existence,” he
decides he wants to introduce a
child in his life, which ironically
contradicts his — free-spirited
persona. He’s not supposed to be
the one philosophizing to Alan,
but rather vice versa — another
strange discontinuity in the
premiere.

Walden is rejected from the
adoption agencies, however,
because his status as a single father

stable married couples. Walden,
disappointed, understands how
marriage is simply not an option for
him, as he notes, “you have to find
the right person — or Mila Kunis.”
This is no accident as Kutcher
and Kunis are very publicly
engaged with a newborn. While
the connection is appropriate,
it does not help the audience’s
difficulty in separating Walden
as an on-screen character from
Kutcher’s persona as an actor.

As a- resolution, Walden
ultimately proposes to Alan to
increase their odds of adopting a
child. Although the ridiculousness
of the situation is meant to elicit
laughs, it rather produces nervous
chuckles of confusion. Is this
the show’s way of making weak
social commentary on same-sex
marriage and adoption?

Meanwhile, the only primary
characters are Alan, Walden
and the occasional insertion of
Berta who is really only there for
comedic timing or as a straight
man, something the show
certainly does not need if there’s
better chemistry between Walden
and Alan. Berta’s character
truly bears an irrelevance and
indifference. In addition, there
are no other subplots to avert
audience attention during the
half an hour, so as interest
atrophies slowly for all secondary
characters, it will soon diminish
for the two primary men, as well.

When Sheen was still present,
the series was known for its lowbrow, dry farce. It perfected the
use of comedic relief, as it was
well-known for — intercutting
moments of sentimental sincerity
to vulgar jokes about boobs
or farts. Unfortunately, a few
after his departure,
“Men” hasn’t started off its final

Julie lovine discusses
changing landscape

WSJ architecture
columnist talks
journalism industry

By KATHLEEN DAVIS
Daily Arts Writer

For the last decade or so,
print journalism
a sharp decline thanks to
technological advancements
that make information so
readily accessible. Paired
with a rough ride through
the latest
journalism has found itself
taking the blunt of section
cuts and layoffs, frequently

has seen

recession, arts

falling second to sections
deemed more important
and profitable like news

and sports. However, some
arts-exclusive journalists
have managed to navigate
the changing landscape of
journalism successfully.
Julie lovine, architecture
columnist for the Wall Street
Journal and the former
Executive Editor for The
Architect’s Newspaper, is
a striking example of this
versatility, and came to the
University’s Taubman College
of Architecture and Urban
Planning last Wednesday to
discuss the changing worlds
of both architecture and arts
journalism.

In an interview with The
Michigan Daily, lovine spoke
about her views on students
breaking into journalism and
the future of architecture.

lovine is a native of
Washington DC and studied
Ancient Greek at Yale before
deciding to become a writer.
She developed a love for
architecture after living
in Athens for a year and
later moved to New York
City to write for various
publications, including the
New York Times, where she
was on staff for 13 years
writing about architecture
and design. In 2008, she
became Executive Editor of
The Architect’s Newspaper,

community.
“What

It has to face the real stuff,

lovine said. “(The recession)

Before leaving The
Architect’s Newspaper,

lovine helped oversee a large
digital expansion, including

launching a sleek website
as well as Facebook and
Twitter platforms. lovine

nods at critics who question
how such a physical art form
can translate over a digital
platform, yet she believes
the advancements have been
positive for architecture.

“It’s a good thing and a bad
thing. It draws even further
architecture’s tendency to
be a beauty contest, because
can just splash these
spectacular photographs
onto the internet and that’s
what people think
it’s all about,” Llovine said.
“However, it also fits itself
very smoothly into the world
of internet visualization.

As architecture
evolved to accommodate
and embrace an eco-friendly
landscape, lovine highlighted
the factors that she takes
into consideration during a
critique of a new building, the
foundation for what she does
at the Wall Street Journal.
In her lecture, she brought
up examples of exceptional
works of architecture, which
she believes has changed the
future of the art.

“I need to be able to figure
out what’s going on, and
without the architect telling
me. It’s important to me that
the building tells me what’s
important, and that the space
is comprehensible to me just

stake in it.”

lovine gave advice to
Taubman students looking
to break into the competitive
world of architecture, from
the point of view of someone

whose critiques can truly
change public opinion
regarding an artist and their
buildings.

“You have to be absolutely
devoted,” Lovine said. “You
must be ready to join the cult
before you take that leap,
and if you do it can be very
rewarding.”

In terms of the everchanging world of niche
arts journalism, lovine

urged national publications
to retain their arts writers
and to keep informing and
shaping public opinion.
“(Arts journalism) will
thrive, but I worry that it
will only thrive among an
inside track and close in on
itself,” lovine said. “The gap
will grow between how the

Taubman graduate studen
Brooke Dexter and Taubman
Alyssa Kargl run
Dimensions, the — studen
architecture publication a
U-M. Dimensions releases one
issue yearly and features the
work of dedicated Taubman
students, as well as the
work of outside professional
sources like lovine.

“One of the things that’s
really important to us is

showcasing
but including voices
from outside that
influence the way students
think,” Dexter said. “For
example, hearing (lovine)
say that architects need to
simplify their words when
talking to  non-architects
is very interesting for us
and helps the student work
stay relevant in the outsic
world.”

“Since (faubman students)
come from the
architecture education,
sometimes while working we
become somewhat similar
minded,” Kargl “We
sometimes get caught in a
certain way of thinking or a
certain way of learning, so
lectures like these are always
refreshing, and offer a new
perspective.

“It’s easy to get too focused
on some small detail of your
project that you are so stuck
on,” Dexter said. “When you
come to lectures like these,
you realize that architecture
is so much bigger than what
you're working on now, and
that’s very refreshing.”

“A degree of architecture
at Taubman is more like a
degree in design,” Kargl said.
“You learn speaking skills,
graphic design and just a lot
of things are embedded into
the degree. You can end up
doing a lot more with the
skills we gain here.”
