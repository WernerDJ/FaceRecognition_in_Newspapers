claims victory in A* mayoral race

Two incumbents,
three newcomers
elected to Council

By EMMA KERR

Daily Staff Reporter
Christopher Taylor was
elected mayor of Ann Arbor
Tuesday night in a landslide
victory, earning 84.21 percent
of the vote. His competitor,
independent candidate Bryan
Kelly, garnered 4,728 votes,
approximately 15.34 percent of
the vote.

Along with Taylor’s assumption of the mayoral seat, City
Councilmembers Sumi Kailasapathy (D-Ward 1) and Chuck
Warpehoski (D-Ward 5) were
reelected as incumbents, in
addition to the three councilmembers elect Julie Grand
(D-Ward 1), Graydon Kraphol
(D-Ward 3) and Kirk Westphal
(D-Ward 2).

“Lam just so excited to have
been elected mayor,” Taylor
said. “It is a great honor and
Ann Arbor is such a wonderful
place: | am thrilled and honored. The city is really going
in the right track. 1 think we
are making progress just taking care of the basics as well as
improving people’s way of life.
We've got a lot to do, we’re not
perfect, but I think these areas
are going in the right direction.”

Since the declaration of his
candidacy in December 2013,
Taylor spent more money than
any other candidate in this
highly contested race. Though
his campaign came toascreeching halt in August, he raised a
total of $75,698 in the months
preceding the primary. Fellow
Councilmembers Stephen Kunselman (D-Ward 3), Sabra Briere (D- Ward 1) and Sally Hart
Petersen (D-Ward 2) all ran in
the Democratic Primary alongside Taylor, who carried 47.57
percent of the vote.

really got her message across.”

In remarks to the media
Tuesday night, Peters characterized his win as the result of
months of traveling the state
and building out grassroots

efforts.

As an independent candidate, Kelly’s goal in the election was not entirely to win,
but rather to spark debate and
turn an uncontested, one-party
election into an opportunity for
further discussion of the issues
surrounding the city. Following
the announcement of his candidacy in July, Kelly did little
campaigning and focused on
developing his position on the
issues themselves through his
website and various mayoral
debates.

Taylor said while his victory
was not a surprise. Kelly took
initiative and showed a passion
for local politics.

“I think that it is a democracy and people who want to run
can and chose to run, and he did

 

make that decision and I hope
that it was an experience that
met his expectations,” Taylor
said.

Taylor is currently in his
third term as a city councilmember representing Ward
3. As the first new mayor in 14
years, Taylor has positioned
himself to follow in current
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje’s footsteps. His approach
to key issues in this election,
which include development.
University and city relations
and addressing infrastructure
needs, echo that of Hieftje’s.

For Kelly, he said the race
was a good experience, generating thoughtful debate about the
issues in Ann Arbor while keeping a lighthearted atmosphere.

happy to see his work didn’t go

According to a poll by the

the 27-percent proportion in the
2010 midterm elections.

Of college students, 31 percent said they would definitely

Larry Kestenbaum, Washtenaw County Clerk and Register of Deeds, said relatively

As of 2 a.m. Wednesday, the

Regents was too close to call.

Republicans Rob Steele and
Ronald Weiser lead with 596,732

The board’s two open seats
are currently held by Regent
Julia Darlow (D), who is not
seeking reelection, and White.

White. who currently serves
as chair of the Board of Regents,
is a professor of law at Wayne

the Detroit Institute of Arts.
He also served as the AmerSlovak Republic under the Bush

Administration.

Steele, a University Inteflex
program alum, is a cardiologist
at St. Joseph Mercy Health System in Ypsilanti and served as
a clinical assistant professor at
the University for more than 20
years.

Behm works as a litigator in
Flint and served as president of
the Michigan Association for
Justice in 2011, a trade association. He worked on former
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and
served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in
2008.

The eight-member board is
elected for eight-year terms on
the statewide ballot. The board
is currently composed of six
Democrats and two Republicans.

In 2012, Mark
Bernstein and Shauna Ryder

Democrats

Diggs won the two open seats
on the board, carried to victory
in part by the presidential race
at the top of the ticket. Similarly, Republicans Andrea Fischer
Newman and Andrew Richner
won the election in 2010, a year
that saw low Democratic turnout and the election of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder.

In this election cycle, all four
major-party candidates emphasized affordability in their plat
forms, but differed on their
plans for its execution.

Steele had said he planned to
finance student loans by tapping
into the University’s endowment, while White said she
intended to strengthen financial
aid. Behm and Weiser see the
University’s satellite campuses
in Dearborn and Flint as additional, more affordable options
for students and said they plan
to strengthen these campuses.

Earlier this month, the candidates met for a candidate forum
at the Gerald R. Ford School of
Public Policy to discuss a variety
of University issues, including
campus climate, the institution’s
response to sexual assault and
working with the city of Detroit.

Most of the candidates shared
similar views on these issues.
such as going to greater lengths
to aid survivors of sexual assault
and working to increase diversity among students within
the boundaries of Proposal 2,
the 2006 ballot initiative that

banned consideration of race in

 

college admissions. Behm also
expressed support for the University’s financial divestment
from fossil fuel companies.

In the last year, the regents
have been involved in several
significant decisions, including
the appointment of University
President Mark Schlissel.

Political Science Prof. Vincent Hutchings said regent
candidates typically don’t gain
as much publicity compared to
other races.

“These lower-level offices put
a bigger burden on the voter.”
Hutchings said. “It is harder
for people to gain information
about these people because
information in the media is less
plentiful.”

are sometimes driven by the top
of the ticket, particularly when
voters cast straight-ticket ballots.

“Straight party ticket voting
may happen a little more frequently when you are down at
the bottom of the ballot,” Wilbanks said. “That historical pattern has held true.”

Ina telephone interview with
The Michigan Daily, Regent
Emeritus Frederick C. Matthaei
said he does not think partisanship plays a large role in the
functioning of the board.

Matthaei was appointed
to the Board in 1967 after the
resignation of his father, the
namesake of the Universitv's botanical gardens. He ran
for reelection a year later as a
Republican nominee, but lost
when Democratic presidential
candidate Hubert Humphrey
carried the state.

“I think their political party
is important only because they
have to run through it.” he said.
“You don’t want eight regents to
be all on the same party. I think
it’s good to have a variety of educated people, number one, and
number two, it’s a question of
how good their personal experiences could be for serving as a
regent, not what political party
they’re in.”
